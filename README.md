# Active Record Queries

In this challenge you'll be working with a single model, `Product`. The database schema has already been created for you.


## Release 0: Setup
Start a virtual environment. 

```
Create env
py -m virtualenv venv 

Start env
source venv/bin/activate

install requirements 
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Release 1: Pass the Tests

Once you've setup the app, your goal is to get all the below tests passing. `cd` into `ormQueries` and run ` ./manage.py test` to see the tests fail.  


The `ProductCrud` class has a number of methods for you to implement. As you work, follow the spec file & review the method names carefully. You'll need to write class methods to make the tests pass. Also, some of the queries will require you to import some modules and functions from `django.db.models`. 

A `Product` record in the database looks like this:
